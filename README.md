### Links
- Live Site URL: [https://qr-code-of-frontend-mentor.netlify.app]


## My process
I used  VS Code for the writing of code, I used media query on the 414px as i was using live server to cast the web on to my mobile phone and it was not working while using media query on 375px so i used media query on 414px and the query is working fine even for the 375px of devices i.e devices having width less than 414px. I am using netlify.com for hosting my web. i have provided the link of my source code in the solution url and the live web in the Live Site URL section. While Programming this page i used the font-size of 20px instead of 15px for heading because it was not looking similar to the screenshot provided. for description text instead of 15px i used 14px for the same reason. I have provided Every Information that i thought was important to be known for you.


### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned
I used everything that i was having knowlegde of, As this was the first challenge i have taken till now so ididn't learn anything new at all but still i think the Front-end Mentor is the best website for the begginers and all the other programmers who are seeking to sharpen their skills.


### Continued development



### Useful resources
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for remembering me of media query. I was forgotten the usage and syntax of media query. And now on forward i will try my best to keep remembering every concept i have learnt till now.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow#formal_syntax) - This helped me to improve my knowledge about box-shadow css property.
