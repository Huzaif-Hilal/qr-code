### What I learned
I used everything that i was having knowlegde of, As this was the first challenge i have taken till now so ididn't learn anything new at all but still i think the Front-end Mentor is the best website for the begginers and all the other programmers who are seeking to sharpen their skills.

### Useful resources
- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me for remembering me of media query. I was forgotten the usage and syntax of media query. And now on forward i will try my best to keep remembering every concept i have learnt till now.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow#formal_syntax) - This helped me to improve my knowledge about box-shadow css property.
